freedom, and enjoy the freshness and purity of the air in this wonderful spot.

And so I did not stir, but lay on my back with my hands under my head looking up into the branches and watching the gleams of light struggle through the tracery of leaf and branch. I thought of many things, in that luxurious half-dreamy way which belongs to the leisure of an habitually busy man. Taking up a thread of thought and dropping it again—swaying between general and particular ideas—in all ways realizing that greatest of pleasures, intellectual laissez aller.

There was in the air the same faint hum of varied sounds which had at the first lulled me to sleep; but somehow the volume was richer than before—more full and satisfying to the ear, and with a special significance, as if not only all nature was speaking but that there was someone voice amongst the myriad more potent than the rest. I listened with a growing interest, and the sound seemed to take a more definite place amongst nature's harmonies. It was not as if it grew in loudness, but merely as if the vibrations accumulated, coming in waves more quickly than they could die away.

Gradually all the other noises seemed to die away, and I heard only this one sound. It seemed to be closer and closer as I began to distinguish more clearly, until I shortly came to the conclusion that its source was separated from me by only some score of yards. Then I began to be able to analyse it a little. In general effect it was like a sort of musical muffled corncrake—a corncrake in a whisper—but with some subtle prevailing sweetness which seemed of almost irresistible attraction. Presently I raised my head from amongst the bracken where I lay, and looked whence the sound proceeded.

There, to my surprise, in an open dell where the light fell through a break in the trees were grouped the children whom I had seen. The two girls were seated, and between them the little boy stood up. One of the girls held in her left hand something which looked like a set of pandean pipes made of thin canes but slightly thicker than wheaten straws. Across this she drew something attached to the fingers of the right hand, which made the bass of the strange corncrake sound. The other girl held a shell with strings across it which she touched lightly; and the boy had a sort of reed flute which gave forth a peculiarly long sweet note, but which blended in the mass of music. Then the girls joined in a sort of monotonous chant of strange sweetness but very, very faint. They were all three looking well to one side of me. By and by the girls stood up; they all turned slightly, and I could see that they were evidently turning slowly in a complete circle, as though seeking in every direction around them. As they began to face my direction I sank down again into the bracken so that they might not see me, for the affair began to absorb my interest. I took care, however, to peep through the fronds of the bracken and see all that went on. A very short time elapsed before my attention was diverted, and in not the most pleasant of ways.

Hearing a stir and rustle among the dead leaves beside me I looked round, and almost jumped to my feet, for there close by, and approaching closer, was a large snake of the blind-worm species. It came straight towards me and actually passed over my feet. I did not stir, and it went on, heeding me no more than if I had been a log of wood, and wriggled away towards the group in the sunlit glade. It was evidently attracted by the strange, weird music, and as this was my first actual experience of serpent-charming my interest grew, and I watched the little party more closely than before. They went on with their music, and the snake approached closer and closer; till at the feet of the fair-haired child it stopped, and, curling itself into a spiral, raised its head and began to hiss. The boy looked down, and the girls turned their eyes towards him, but the music did not stop for a moment; on the contrary, it grew something quicker. Then the snake twined itself around the child's ankle and began to climb its way up his body, wriggling round and round his leg and thigh, and up and up, till at last it crawled along
the arm that held the flute.

Then, suddenly, the music stopped. The two
girls stood up, and the boy stretched out his arm
with the snake wound around it, with his hand
stretched out wide open, the palm upward.
The snake remained perfectly still, as if transformed
into stone. Then the girls took hands and circled
slowly around the boy, uttering a low, whispering,
mysterious chant, something the same as the earlier
one, but this time in decrescendo as compared with
the former crescendo, and in a minor key. This
went on for quite two or three minutes. The boy
remained perfectly still, with his arm extended,
and his blue eyes fixed on the snake. Then the
latter raised its head slightly and seemed to follow
with it the movements of the circling girls. They
continued their slow movement, round and round,
the snake's movements being more and more
pronounced with each revolution, till presently it was
boldly turning, like the automatic motion of a
firework, around the boy’s arm. Gradually the
motion of the girls got slower and the snake
correspondingly less, till, presently, the girls’
movement, and the low droning music, which had
never stopped, died away altogether, and the snake
hung, a dead mass as limp as a piece of string,
across the boy's hand. The boy never moved, but
the girls let go each other's hands, and one of them,
who had stopped just in front of the boy, took the
snake by head and tail and seemed to gently pull
it out straight. When she let it go, it lay across the
boy's hand as stiff as a piece of wood. There was
something uncanny about this which recalled to me
recollections of a man whom I had once seen in a
cataleptic fit, and whose body retained any position
into which it was put, no matter how grotesque or
how uncomfortable or strained. The snake seemed
to be under some similar condition, and with strange
curiosity I awaited the next development. The boy
continued impassive, his hand still stretched out and
the snake resting across it. The girls stood a little
in front of him, one on either side, so that the
outstretched hand was midway between them.


Then began some questioning between them in
a language which I presumed to be some form
of Indian, but which I did not understand. Both
voices were sweet, with a peculiar penetrating
power, but one of them I seemed instinctively to
fear, although it was the sweeter and softer of the
two. Somehow—and the idea was quite spontaneous—
it seemed to suggest murder. From the tones and
inflections of the voices, I gathered that all
utterances were put in the form of questions—a
supposition shortly confirmed in a strange way,
for the answers were given by the rigid snake.
When each girl in turn had had her say—and they
suggested positive and negative in their tones—the
snake would slowly turn around like the needle in
a compass, and point its head to either one. The
sweeter voice seemed to be the positive, and the
other the negative in the inquiry; and in all the
earlier questions, the snake, after turning slowly
around, remained with its head towards the
negative. This first seemed to disturb and then
annoy the positive inquirer, and her voice grew
more deadly sweet and penetrating until it made
me shudder. Then she seemed to get more and
more enraged, for her eyes gleamed with a dark
unholy light, and at the same time came her
question in a keen thrilling whisper. For answer,
the snake then spun around quicker and quicker,
and suddenly—

The disappointed one gave one fierce, short,
inhospitable hiss, while a look of deadly malice
swept over her face; and then passed away, leaving
it as serene as before. At the same instant, the
rigidity of the snake collapsed, and it hung for an
instant as limp as before, and then slipped to the
ground and lay there all in a heap without motion,
as if dead. The boy started, as though from sleep
to waking, and began to laugh. The girls joined in
the cachinnation, and in an instant the glade, which
had seemed so weird, grew instinct with laughter,
as the children chased each other into
