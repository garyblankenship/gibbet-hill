When I left the Royal Huts Inn, on the top of Hind Head, in order to visit the Devil's Punch. bowl and Gibbet
Hill, immortalized by
Turner
in the Liber
Studiorium, I passed along a wide
straight road— the new high road between and Portsmouth-
London
and shortly came to the edge of
the Punchbowl and easted my eyes on its beauty.
The fog, which had been heavy in London when I left on this mid-October even to
morning,

hung in the valleys so
that the tops of the Surrey hills
rose like islands
from the sea of mist, and in the brilliant sunshine which glorified these upper levels softened and mellowed all the wide expanse of hill and dale and down which ranged between me and the
Southern coast.
The hill
gave steeply on
all
sides save the north-west,
where the circular
valley opened to the plain below.
All the sum-
mer tints were chastened and mellowed ; all the full colours which the sunshine had glorified had faded into the sere of Autumn. The pink and purple of the heather were changed toa brown with only
suggestion of faded
colour to warm
its tone.
The bracken was of rich amber and faded yellow, and the myriads of grasses and wild flowers had donned their winter garb
of decay.

tints, the

For a few seconds I stood looking at this group, they regarding me steadfastly without the slightest movement.

some remark about the beauty of the scene. Une of the girls said, tapping the stone with her hand as she spoke.

My departure from London had been early, and the walk from Hazlemere in the blazing October sun a little fatiguing, so, after a while, when I had been all around the summit of the Head and had, so to speak, boxed the scenie compass, I took my way to a deep shady grove of hazel and beech with tall pines rising over all-

copses that creep
up
from the valley, throwing
jagged spikes of
greenery up the slopes
of the
hill.

that mysterious sense of elapsed time which tells philosophers that our thought is

Where
was, however, no
sense of duty omitted-no press of coming work, which in such cases destroys the charm of awak. ing.
I knew that there was ample time before me, and that I might muse on, unchecked, that I could revel to my heart's content in the sense of

freedom, and enjoy the freshness and purity of the air in this wonderful spot.
And so I did not stir, but lay on my back with my hands under my head looking up into the branches

Then I rose up from the bracken where I lay I could hardly believe my eyes, and thought tha I must have been sleeping, and have dreamt it all.
But there
lay
the seemingly dead saake
before me as a palpable evidence that I had beheld
B reality.
The sun was
far in the west when I had
finished my
stroll through the laneways and
copses upon the Witley side of Hind Head and found myself once more at its highest point on Gibbet Hill.
The place was nOW deserted.
The
picnicers had all gone home; the pony traps and donkeys and parties of school children had disappeared, and nothing remained of the day's visitation but the usual increase in old newspapers and broken egg shells.
As the light was
just beginning to fade and the air to grow a shade colder, the sense of lonliness was more than ever marked.
But Ihad come
from the midst of the
hum and turmoil of the city to enjoy
this very
loneliness, and its luxury was to me unspeakable.
Down in the valleys the mist still lay dim and fleecy
white, and from it the hill tops rose dark andgrim. A belt of cloud fringed the whole horizon, and above it stretched a sea of sulphur yellow, flecked here and there with little clouds of white which, swimming high above the level of the hill, caught the last splendours of the sun, now ob. scured by the horizon.
One or two stars began
to twinkle through the darkening sky, and a still ness that seemed sentent stole up through the valley and reached to where I sat.
Then the air grew colder, and the silence be-

I sat on and on, and drank in the
wondrous
beauty in which
I was immersed.
Weariness of mind and body seemed of the dim past, and as if they could never again be other than a sad memory. In such möments a man seems almost be born again, and to have every faculty renewed to the full.
I leaned with
my back against the great stone cross, and, putting my hands behind me, clasped mỳ arms around its back so as to change my position and be able to enjoy more fully the luxury of rest.
Suddenly, without a word of warning,

hand was grasped from behind and held tight in a pair of hands, thin and warm but so strong that I could make no movement; and at the same time a scarf or shawl of some light, fleecy, but thick material was thrown over my tace and drawn tightly from behind, holding my head close to the stone.
So pinioned and gagged, I could neither move nor speak, and had perforce to await the coming events.
