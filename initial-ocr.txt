“Can you tell us anything about this stone,
Sir? We are strangers”

“Tam a stranger here myself, but I think wa
will find it here,” I answered, as 1 proceeded to
read the inscription, which is on both sides of
the stone. WhenI read of the word murder they
all three looked at each other and then at me,
and shuddered, and, strango to say, followed tho
shudder with ‘a smile, thought
they might be frightoned, and I hastened
to add—“But you need’ not let this
disturb you. It all’ happened a hundred years
ago, when thecountry was very different from
whai ibis gow.” One of the girls said ina low
‘voice, whose toues were peculiarly penetrating,

“Thope not—I trnst not; and the little boy
looked up at me with a laugh and said

© L suppose if theré were a murder now some

one would be stuck up on Gibbet Hill!”
_ “Hallo! young man,” said I, “You know allabout
it, Isee. “Lam going up to the hill top to see the
‘Memorial Cross. Will yon come and see where
they put the murdever ? ”

“With pleasure.”he said, with en air of almost
supematural gravity, lifting his cap in acknow-
ledgment of my invitstion. The girls bowed
too, and ‘we all moved up the hill together. As
we went I noticed that the boy had one of his
hands tightly clenched. “ What have you got
there?" Tasked of him.

“Thess!” he said, opening bis hand and
showing me a crumpled mass of great carth
‘worms, wriggling in their sudden freedom. “ I
love worms,” he went on, * See lihey wriggle so,
and you can pull them out long!” and he illus:
trated the latter fact.

“Poor worms!” said I, “ Why not let them
go? ‘Chey would much rather be on the
gromd.” + *

“Shan't,” wag his only reply, as he shoved
them into thé folds of his tunic,

‘There were a lot of persons at the cross when
‘we reached the top of Gibbet Hill, besides abund-
ant evidence of recent visitors in the shape of
egg-shells and pieces of newspaper—for the cross
isa favourite picnicing pot. Amongst the
strangers my fancy was chielly teken bya lady
and gentleman whom I dubbed “ the honeymoon
couple.” I soon became s0 absorbed by the
lovely view whicl lay stretched before me—a
wilderness of rising, hill-tops with green woods
and rich valleys—that I quite forgot my young
companions, I went to thoedge of ‘the steep hill
and sat down looiting eastwards, end lost myself
in tho beauty of the scene.

Presently 1 remembered my young companions,
and looked around for them } but they had quite
disappeared: there was not a sight of them
anywaere around,

‘My departure from London had been early, and
the walk from Hazlemere in the blazing October
sun a little fatiguing, so, after a while, when I
had beon all around the summit of the Head and
had, so to speak, boxed the scenic compass, I took
my way to a deep shady grove of hazel and beech
‘with tall pines rising over all—one of those dense
copses that ereop up from the valley, throwing
jagged spikes of greenery up the slopes of the

matic odour which they exhaled—the sleepy
silence, accentuated only by the ium of nature's
myriad vitalities—the soft, rich grass, whoso
summer greenery stood untouched as yet in this
sheliered dell—all invited to repose.” With a
blissful feeling of content I stretched myself on
the grass, and soon lost my thoughts and my
constioustess in tho interlaced branches above
me. )

before—more full and satisfying to the ear, and |
with a special significance, as if not only all
nature was speaking but that there was some

the sound seemed to take a more definite placo
amongst nature's harmonies. Tt was not as if it
grew in loudness, but merely as if the vibrations

to be closer and closer as I began to distinguish

| only some score of yards. ‘hen I began to be
| ablo to analyse it a'little, In general erect it was

crake in a whisper—but with some subtle prevail-
| ing sweetness which seemed of almost irresistible

atiraction. Presently I raised my hoad from
amongst the bracken where I lay, and looked
whence the sound proceeded.
| ‘There, to my surprise, in an open dell where
the light fell through a break in the trees were
grouped the children whom I hed seen. ‘Phe
two girls were scated, and between them the
little boy stood up. One of the girls held in
her left"hand something which looked like a
set of pandean pives made of thin cancs but
slightly thicker than wheaten straws. Across
this she drew somethingattached to the fingers
of the right hand, which made the bassof the
strange cornorake sound. ‘The other gitl held a
shell With strings across it which she touched
lightly ; and the boy bad a sort of reed flute
which gave forth a peculiarly long sweet note,
but. which blended in the mass of imusic. ‘Then
the girls joined in a sorb of — monotonous
chant of strange sweetness but very, very faint.
They were all three looking well to one side of
me. By andby the girls stood up ; they all
tumed slightly, and I could see that they were
evidently turning slowly in a complete circle, as
though seeking in every direction around them.
As they began to face my direction I sank down
again into the bracken so that they migat not
see me, for tho affair began to absorb my in-
terest. I took care, however, to peep through tho
fronds of the bracken and see all that weat om.
‘A very short time elapsed before my attention
was diverted, aud in not the most pleasant of
ways.

Hearing a stir and rustle among the dead
leaves beside me I looked round, and almost
jumped to my foot, for there close by, and ap-
proachiug closer, was a large snake of the blind.

‘Then, suddenly, the musie stopped. ‘The two
givls stood up, and the boy stretcned out his arm
with the snake wound around it, with his hand
stretched out wide open, the palm upwar
‘The snake remained perfectly still, as if trans-
formed into stone. ‘then tho girls took
hands and eircled slowly around the boy, uttering
alow, whispering, mysterious chant, something
‘the same as the earlier one, but this time in de-
crescendo as compared with the former crescendo,
and in'a mizor key. This went on for quite two
or three minates. ‘The boy remained perfectly
still, with his arm extended, and his blue eyes
fixed on the snake, ‘Then the latter raised “its
head alightly and soamed to follow with it the
movements of the circling girls. They continued
their slow movement, round and round, the
snake's movements being more and more pro-
nounced with each revolution, till presently it was
boldly turning, like the automatic motion of a
firework, around the boy’s arm. Gradually the
motion of the girls got slower and tiav oi the
snake correspondingly less, till, presentiy, the
girls’ movement, and tho low c1ooning
music, which had never stopped, died away
altogether, and the snake hung, a dead mass a3
limp as a piece of string, across the boy's hand,
‘The boy never moved, but the gitls let go each
others’ hands, and one of them, who had stopped
just in front of the boy, took the snake by head
and tail and seemed to gently pull it out siraight,
‘When sho je! it go it lay across the boy's hand

into which it was put, no matter how grotesque or
how uncomfortable or stramed. ‘The snake
