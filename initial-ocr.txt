“Can you tell us anything about this stone,
Sir? We are strangers”

“Tam a stranger here myself, but I think wa
will find it here,” I answered, as 1 proceeded to
read the inscription, which is on both sides of
the stone. WhenI read of the word murder they
all three looked at each other and then at me,
and shuddered, and, strango to say, followed tho
shudder with ‘a smile, thought
they might be frightoned, and I hastened
to add—“But you need’ not let this
disturb you. It all’ happened a hundred years
ago, when thecountry was very different from
whai ibis gow.” One of the girls said ina low
‘voice, whose toues were peculiarly penetrating,

“Thope not—I trnst not; and the little boy
looked up at me with a laugh and said

© L suppose if theré were a murder now some

one would be stuck up on Gibbet Hill!”
_ “Hallo! young man,” said I, “You know allabout
it, Isee. “Lam going up to the hill top to see the
‘Memorial Cross. Will yon come and see where
they put the murdever ? ”

“With pleasure.”he said, with en air of almost
supematural gravity, lifting his cap in acknow-
ledgment of my invitstion. The girls bowed
too, and ‘we all moved up the hill together. As
we went I noticed that the boy had one of his
hands tightly clenched. “ What have you got
there?" Tasked of him.

“Thess!” he said, opening bis hand and
showing me a crumpled mass of great carth
‘worms, wriggling in their sudden freedom. “ I
love worms,” he went on, * See lihey wriggle so,
and you can pull them out long!” and he illus:
trated the latter fact.

“Poor worms!” said I, “ Why not let them
go? ‘Chey would much rather be on the
gromd.” + *

“Shan't,” wag his only reply, as he shoved
them into thé folds of his tunic,

‘There were a lot of persons at the cross when
‘we reached the top of Gibbet Hill, besides abund-
ant evidence of recent visitors in the shape of
egg-shells and pieces of newspaper—for the cross
isa favourite picnicing pot. Amongst the
strangers my fancy was chielly teken bya lady
and gentleman whom I dubbed “ the honeymoon
couple.” I soon became s0 absorbed by the
lovely view whicl lay stretched before me—a
wilderness of rising, hill-tops with green woods
and rich valleys—that I quite forgot my young
companions, I went to thoedge of ‘the steep hill
and sat down looiting eastwards, end lost myself
in tho beauty of the scene.

Presently 1 remembered my young companions,
and looked around for them } but they had quite
disappeared: there was not a sight of them
anywaere around,

‘My departure from London had been early, and
the walk from Hazlemere in the blazing October
sun a little fatiguing, so, after a while, when I
had beon all around the summit of the Head and
had, so to speak, boxed the scenic compass, I took
my way to a deep shady grove of hazel and beech
‘with tall pines rising over all—one of those dense
copses that ereop up from the valley, throwing
jagged spikes of greenery up the slopes of the

matic odour which they exhaled—the sleepy
silence, accentuated only by the ium of nature's
myriad vitalities—the soft, rich grass, whoso
summer greenery stood untouched as yet in this
sheliered dell—all invited to repose.” With a
blissful feeling of content I stretched myself on
the grass, and soon lost my thoughts and my
constioustess in tho interlaced branches above
me. )

with a special significance, as if not only all

crake in a whisper—but with some subtle prevail-

atiraction. Presently I raised my hoad from
amongst the bracken where I lay, and looked
whence the sound proceeded.
| ‘There, to my surprise, in an open dell where
the light fell through a break in the trees were
grouped the children whom I hed seen. ‘Phe
two girls were scated, and between them the
little boy stood up. One of the girls held in
her left"hand something which looked like a
set of pandean pives made of thin cancs but
slightly thicker than wheaten straws. Across
this she drew somethingattached to the fingers
of the right hand, which made the bassof the
strange cornorake sound. ‘The other gitl held a
shell With strings across it which she touched
lightly ; and the boy bad a sort of reed flute
which gave forth a peculiarly long sweet note,
but. which blended in the mass of imusic. ‘Then
the girls joined in a sorb of — monotonous
chant of strange sweetness but very, very faint.
They were all three looking well to one side of
me. By andby the girls stood up ; they all
tumed slightly, and I could see that they were
evidently turning slowly in a complete circle, as
though seeking in every direction around them.
As they began to face my direction I sank down
again into the bracken so that they migat not
see me, for tho affair began to absorb my in-
terest. I took care, however, to peep through tho
fronds of the bracken and see all that weat om.
‘A very short time elapsed before my attention
was diverted, aud in not the most pleasant of
ways.

Hearing a stir and rustle among the dead
leaves beside me I looked round, and almost
jumped to my foot, for there close by, and ap-

hands and eircled slowly around the boy, uttering
alow, whispering, mysterious chant, something
‘the same as the earlier one, but this time in de-
crescendo as compared with the former crescendo,
and in'a mizor key. This went on for quite two
or three minates. ‘The boy remained perfectly
still, with his arm extended, and his blue eyes
fixed on the snake, ‘Then the latter raised “its
head alightly and soamed to follow with it the
movements of the circling girls. They continued
their slow movement, round and round, the
snake's movements being more and more pro-
nounced with each revolution, till presently it was
boldly turning, like the automatic motion of a
firework, around the boy’s arm. Gradually the
motion of the girls got slower and tiav oi the
snake correspondingly less, till, presentiy, the
girls’ movement, and tho low c1ooning
music, which had never stopped, died away
altogether, and the snake hung, a dead mass a3
limp as a piece of string, across the boy's hand,

Then I rose up from the bracken where I lay I could hardly believe my eyes, and thought tha I must have been sleeping, and have dreamt it all.
But there
lay
the seemingly dead saake
before me as a palpable evidence that I had beheld
B reality.
The sun was
far in the west when I had
finished my
stroll through the laneways and
copses upon the Witley side of Hind Head and found myself once more at its highest point on Gibbet Hill.
The place was nOW deserted.
The
picnicers had all gone home; the pony traps and donkeys and parties of school children had disappeared, and nothing remained of the day's visitation but the usual increase in old newspapers and broken egg shells.
As the light was
just beginning to fade and the air to grow a shade colder, the sense of lonliness was more than ever marked.
But Ihad come
from the midst of the
hum and turmoil of the city to enjoy
this very
loneliness, and its luxury was to me unspeakable.
Down in the valleys the mist still lay dim and fleecy
white, and from it the hill tops rose dark andgrim. A belt of cloud fringed the whole horizon, and above it stretched a sea of sulphur yellow, flecked here and there with little clouds of white which, swimming high above the level of the hill, caught the last splendours of the sun, now ob. scured by the horizon.
One or two stars began
to twinkle through the darkening sky, and a still ness that seemed sentent stole up through the valley and reached to where I sat.
Then the air grew colder, and the silence be-
perfect.

I sat on and on, and drank in the
wondrous
beauty in which
I was immersed.
Weariness of mind and body seemed of the dim past, and as if they could never again be other than a sad memory. In such möments a man seems almost be born again, and to have every faculty renewed to the full.
I leaned with
my back against the great stone cross, and, putting my hands behind me, clasped mỳ arms around its back so as to change my position and be able to enjoy more fully the luxury of rest.
Suddenly, without a word of warning,
eac
hand was grasped from behind and held tight in a pair of hands, thin and warm but so strong that I could make no movement; and at the same time a scarf or shawl of some light, fleecy, but thick material was thrown over my tace and drawn tightly from behind, holding my head close to the stone.
So pinioned and gagged, I could neither move nor speak, and had perforce to await the coming events.
Then my hands were tied with a
