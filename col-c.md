the recesses of the wood, and disappeared from view.

Then I rose up from the bracken where I lay. I could hardly believe my eyes, and thought that I must have been sleeping, and have dreamt it all. But there lay the seemingly dead snake before me as a palpable evidence that I had beheld a reality.

The sun was far in the west when I had finished my stroll through the laneways and copses upon the Witley side of Hind Head and found myself once more at its highest point on Gibbet Hill.

The place was now deserted. The picnicers had all gone home; the pony traps and donkeys and parties of school children had disappeared, and nothing remained of the day's visitation but the usual increase in old newspapers and broken egg shells. As the light was just beginning to fade and the air to grow a shade colder, the sense of loneliness was more than ever marked. But I had come from the midst of the hum and turmoil of the city to enjoy this very loneliness, and its luxury was to me unspeakable.

Down in the valleys the mist still lay dim and fleecy white, and from it the hill tops rose dark and grim. A belt of cloud fringed the whole horizon, and above it stretched a sea of sulphur yellow, flecked here and there with little clouds of white which, swimming high above the level of the hill, caught the last splendours of the sun, now obscured by the horizon. One or two stars began to twinkle through the darkening sky, and a stillness that seemed sentient stole up through the valley and reached to where I sat.

Then the air grew colder, and the silence became perfect. The stars swam out into the sky, which had now a darker blue, and a soft light fell on the scene. I sat on and on, and drank in the wondrous beauty in which I was immersed. Weariness of mind and body seemed of the dim past, and as if they could never again be other than a sad memory. In such moments a man seems almost to be born again, and to have every faculty renewed to the full. I leaned with my back against the great stone cross, and, putting my hands behind me, clasped my arms around its back so as to change my position and be able to enjoy more fully the luxury of rest.

Suddenly, without a word of warning, each hand was grasped from behind and held tight in a pair of hands, thin and warm but so strong that I could make no movement; and at the same time a scarf or shawl of some light, fleecy, but thick material was thrown over my face and drawn tightly from behind, holding my head close to the stone. So pinioned and gagged, I could neither move nor speak, and had perforce to await the coming events. Then my hands were tied with a string put around the wrists and drawn tight, so that I was fixed more firmly than before. I could hear no sound, and took it for granted that I was being prepared for robbery. I was alone, far away from everyone and in the hands of men stronger than myself, and so resigned myself to the situation as well as I could—secretly thankful that I had only a small sum of money with me. After a time which seemed long, but which was probably of but a few minutes' duration, the scarf was pulled down so far that my eyes were free, though my mouth was still covered and I was unable to cry out.

For a few moments I was too much surprised even to think as strange what I saw before me. Instead of burly footpads with rude manner and coarse force, there were the three children who had arrested my attention earlier in the day. They stood before me perfectly still and silent for a little while, their eyes being the only features which expressed either consciousness or interest of any kind. Two of them, the boy and one girl, then smiled on me with an amused superiority, whilst the other—she who in the glade had exhibited such anger—smiled with a deadly cold hate which, bound as I was, made me shudder. This latter then approached me closer, the others remaining quite still and looking on with their superior amused smile. She took from her waist, where it was concealed in the folds of her dress, a long sharp dagger, thin, double-edged, and lethal-looking. This she proceeded to flourish before me with extraordinary dexterity and rapidity. Half the time its keen
edge actually touched my skin, and the contact
made me wince. Anon she would dart towards my
eyes till I could feel its cold point actually touching
my eyeballs. Then she would, as if hurling herself
at me with the point of the deadly weapon,
directed to my heart, but would stop just as it
seemed that my last moment had come. This
went on for a little while; but short though it
was, it seemed endless. I felt a cold chill, strange
numbness, growing over me; my heart seemed
to get cold and weak—colder, and colder—
weaker and weaker still, till at length my eyes
closed. I tried to open them—succeeded; tried
again—failed, succeeded—failed—and at length
consciousness passed away from me.

The last thing I remember seeing with my
waking eyes was the gleam of the long knife in
the starlight as it moved in the young girl's dexterous
play. The last sound I heard was a low laugh
from all three of the children.

The voice in my ears was dim and distant;
but it gradually grew louder, and the spoken
words became intelligible:—

“Wake up! Wake up, man! You will get
your death of cold!”

Coldly the word struck home, for there was
at my heart a numbness, and a chill as of death.
My consciousness struggled back into existence,
and I opened my eyes.

It was now much brighter, for a great yellow
moon had arisen, and the common was flooded
with its light. Beside me were two persons whom
at once I recognized as the “honeymoon couple”
of earlier in the day. The man was bending
over me and was shaking me roughly by the
shoulder, whilst the lady stood by, looking on
anxiously, with her hands clasped.

“Is he not dead, George, is he?” I heard her
say. The answer came.

“No! thank goodness!—He must have fallen
asleep. It is a mercy that you had the inspiration
to come out to see the moonlight view from
here; he might have died of cold. See! the
ground is white with the hoar-frost already.
Wake up, man!—Wake up, and come away!”

“My heart,” I murmured, “My heart!” for it
was icy cold. The man looked more serious, and
said to his wife:—

“Bella, this may be serious. Could you run
back to the hotel, and send someone if necessary?
It may be that his heart is affected.”

“Certainly, dear; shall I go at once?”

“Wait a minute first.” He leaned over me
again. The past was coming back to me quickly,
and I asked him:

“Did you see anywhere some children,
two Indian girls, and a fair-haired boy?”

“Yes! hours and hours ago, as they went down
the London road on a tricycle. They were
laughing, and we thought them the prettiest and
happiest children we had ever seen. But why?”

“My heart! my heart!” I cried out again,
for there was a coldness which seemed to numb me.

The man put his hand over my heart, but
quickly tore it away again with a cry of terror.

“What is it, George? What is it?” almost
shrieked the lady, for his action was so sudden
and unexpected that it thoroughly frightened me.

He stood back, and she clung frightened to his
arm, as a large blindworm wriggled itself out
from my bosom—fell on the ground—and glided
away down the hillside into the copse below.
