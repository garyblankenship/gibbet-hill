When I left the Royal Huts Inn, on the top
of Hind Head, in order to visit the Devil’s Punchbowl
and Gibbet Hill, immortalized by Turner
in the Liber Studiorum, I passed along a wide
straight road—the new high road between London
and Portsmouth—and shortly came to the edge of
the Punchbowl and cast my eyes on its beauty.
The fog, which had been heavy in London when
I left on this mid-October morning, extended
even to Haslemere and hung in the valleys so
that the tops of the Surrey hills rose like islands
from the sea of mist, and in the brilliant sunshine
which glorified these upper levels softened
and mellowed all the wide expanse of hill and
dale and down which ranged between me and
the Southern coast. The hill gave steeply on
all sides save the north-west, where the circular
valley opened to the plain below. All the summer
tints were chastened and mellowed; all the
full colours which the sunshine had glorified had
faded into the sere of Autumn. The pink and purple
of the heather were changed to a brown with only
a suggestion of faded colour to warm its tone.
The bracken was of rich amber and faded yellow,
and the myriads of grasses and wild flowers had
donned their winter garb—the hues of decay.
Through all this rich mass of Autumn tints, the
broom, untouched as yet by the frost, sent an
emerald flash. The green bushes which fringed 
the tiny stream running through the valley 
seemed of supernatural vividness, and the dark
green of the pines which covered the western
slope and ran down into the valley seemed to
assert in some positive way the right of nature
to maintain her own colour despite all influences.
Away to the north and west, past the
spurs and shoulders of the hill, the woods and
valleys, the copses and villages and hills and
ridges ranged in endless succession; and it was
after a long, long pause that I turned from drink-
ing in the beauty of the scene with my heart full
of the power and majesty and purifying influence
of nature’s beauty. “Here at least,” said I to my-
self, “the soul of man is elevated; and on this
higher plane of nature’s handiwork the evil of our
hearts is lulled.”

As I turned, however, I started, for, as if by the
irony of fate, there, beside me, was a grim
memorial of man’s wickedness and lust for blood—
a tombstone by the roadside, marking the
spot where a century ago a poor seaman trudging
on his way from Portsmouth was murdered.

But not the stone only was of interest; for by it
were three figures which would have arrested at-
tention anywhere. They were only children, but of
types that were not common. Two were young
Indian girls of an age which by the slower de-
velopment of English girlhood would be about
some thirteen or fourteen years; being,
however, of Eastern birth, they were
probably much younger. They stood
one on each side of the memorial stone,
looking almost like heraldic supporters, as each
with a slim brown hand resting on an elbow of the
stone, leaned her face on the hand
while looking at me gravely with long, dark,
fathomless eyes. They were both very pretty of
their type, and their slim girlish figures were
draped in black of some shimmering material,
made in a half Eastern fashion with a wide belt
of the stuff round the waist, and some kind of
dark material wound around the head and acting
as a head gear. The third of the group was a
little boy of some ten years old, with hair of spun
gold, eyes like blue porcelain, and a winning
smile on his rosy face. One might designate him
indifferently a Cupid or an angel. He was
dressed in a dark blood-coloured tunic.

For a few seconds I stood looking at this group,
they regarding me steadfastly without the slight-
est movement. Then I spoke to them, making
some remarks about the beauty of the scene. One
of the girls said, tapping the stone with her hand
as she spoke.
