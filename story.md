Gibbet Hill
===========

BRAM STOKER

December 17, 1890

When I left the Royal Huts Inn, on the top
of Hind Head, in order to visit the Devil’s Punchbowl
and Gibbet Hill, immortalized by Turner
in the Liber Studiorum, I passed along a wide
straight road—the new high road between London
and Portsmouth—and shortly came to the edge of
the Punchbowl and cast my eyes on its beauty.
The fog, which had been heavy in London when
I left on this mid-October morning, extended
even to Haslemere and hung in the valleys so
that the tops of the Surrey hills rose like islands
from the sea of mist, and in the brilliant sunshine
which glorified these upper levels softened
and mellowed all the wide expanse of hill and
dale and down which ranged between me and
the Southern coast. The hill gave steeply on
all sides save the north-west, where the circular
valley opened to the plain below. All the summer
tints were chastened and mellowed; all the
full colours which the sunshine had glorified had
faded into the sere of Autumn. The pink and purple
of the heather were changed to a brown with only
a suggestion of faded colour to warm its tone.
The bracken was of rich amber and faded yellow,
and the myriads of grasses and wild flowers had
donned their winter garb—the hues of decay.
Through all this rich mass of Autumn tints, the
broom, untouched as yet by the frost, sent an
emerald flash. The green bushes which fringed 
the tiny stream running through the valley 
seemed of supernatural vividness, and the dark
green of the pines which covered the western
slope and ran down into the valley seemed to
assert in some positive way the right of nature
to maintain her own colour despite all influences.
Away to the north and west, past the
spurs and shoulders of the hill, the woods and
valleys, the copses and villages and hills and
ridges ranged in endless succession; and it was
after a long, long pause that I turned from drink-
ing in the beauty of the scene with my heart full
of the power and majesty and purifying influence
of nature’s beauty. “Here at least,” said I to my-
self, “the soul of man is elevated; and on this
higher plane of nature’s handiwork the evil of our
hearts is lulled.”

As I turned, however, I started, for, as if by the
irony of fate, there, beside me, was a grim
memorial of man’s wickedness and lust for blood—
a tombstone by the roadside, marking the
spot where a century ago a poor seaman trudging
on his way from Portsmouth was murdered.

But not the stone only was of interest; for by it
were three figures which would have arrested attention
anywhere. They were only children, but of
types that were not common. Two were young
Indian girls of an age which by the slower development
of English girlhood would be about
some thirteen or fourteen years; being,
however, of Eastern birth, they were
probably much younger. They stood
one on each side of the memorial stone,
looking almost like heraldic supporters, as each
with a slim brown hand resting on an elbow of the
stone, leaned her face on the hand
while looking at me gravely with long, dark,
fathomless eyes. They were both very pretty of
their type, and their slim girlish figures were
draped in black of some shimmering material,
made in a half Eastern fashion with a wide belt
of the stuff round the waist, and some kind of
dark material wound around the head and acting
as a head gear. The third of the group was a
little boy of some ten years old, with hair of spun
gold, eyes like blue porcelain, and a winning
smile on his rosy face. One might designate him
indifferently a Cupid or an angel. He was
dressed in a dark blood-coloured tunic.

For a few seconds I stood looking at this group,
they regarding me steadfastly without the slight-
est movement. Then I spoke to them, making
some remarks about the beauty of the scene. One
of the girls said, tapping the stone with her hand
as she spoke.

“Can you tell us anything about this stone,
Sir? We are strangers.”

“I am a stranger here myself, but I think we
will find it here,” I answered, as I proceeded to
read the inscription, which is on both sides of
the stone. When I read the word 'murder,' they 
all three looked at each other and then at me,
and shuddered. Strange to say, they followed the 
shudder with a smile, though
they might be frightened, and I hastened
to add—“But you need not let this
disturb you. It all happened a hundred years 
ago, when the country was very different from
what it is now.” One of the girls said in a low 
voice, whose tones were peculiarly penetrating,

“I hope not—I trust not;” and the little boy
looked up at me with a laugh and said,

“I suppose if there were a murder now, some
one would be stuck up on Gibbet Hill!”

“Hallo! young man,” said I, “You know all about 
it, I see. I am going up to the hilltop to see the
Memorial Cross. Will you come and see where
they put the murderer?”

“With pleasure,” he said, with an air of almost
supernatural gravity, lifting his cap in acknowledgment
of my invitation. The girls bowed 
too, and we all moved up the hill together. As
we went, I noticed that the boy had one of his
hands tightly clenched. “What have you got
there?” I asked him.

“These!” he said, opening his hand and
showing me a crumpled mass of great earthworms,
wriggling in their sudden freedom. “I
love worms,” he went on. “See how they wriggle so,
and you can pull them out long!” and he illustrated
the latter fact.

“Poor worms!” said I. “Why not let them
go? They would much rather be on the ground.”

“Shan't,” was his only reply, as he shove
them into the folds of his tunic.

There were a lot of people at the cross when
we reached the top of Gibbet Hill, besides abundant
evidence of recent visitors in the shape of
ggshells and pieces of newspaper—for the cross
is a favorite picnicking spot. Amongst the
strangers, my fancy was chiefly taken by a lady
and gentleman whom I dubbed “the honeymoon
couple.” I soon became so absorbed by the
lovely view that lay stretched before me—a
wilderness of rising hilltops with green woods
and rich valleys—that I quite forgot my young 
companions. I went to the edge of the steep hill
and sat down looking eastwards, and lost myself
in the beauty of the scene.

Presently, I remembered my young companions
and looked around for them; but they had quite
disappeared—there was not a sight of them anywhere around.

My departure from London had been early, and
the walk from Hazlemere in the blazing October
sun a little fatiguing, so after a while, when I
had been all around the summit of the Head and
had, so to speak, boxed the scenic compass, I took
my way to a deep shady grove of hazel and beech
with tall pines rising over all—one of those dense
copses that creep up from the valley, throwing
jagged spikes of greenery up the slopes of the hill.
Here there was the very perfection of
autumn fullness. The undergrowth grew luxuriantly
under the shelter of the clustering pines.
The brown of the bark and the bluish bloom of
the foliage of the pines, as one gazed into the
half-dim aisles between them—the sweet aromatic
odor which they exhaled—the sleepy
silence, accentuated only by the hum of nature's
myriad vitalities—the soft, rich grass, whose
summer greenery stood untouched as yet in this
sheltered dell—all invited repose. With a
blissful feeling of content, I stretched myself on
the grass and soon lost my thoughts and my
consciousness in the interlaced branches above me.

How long I slept, I know not; but it must have
been a good while, for I felt thoroughly refreshed
as to brain, and with that half-aching sense of
cramped muscles which comes after a long period
of unchanged attitude; and there was over me
that mysterious sense of elapsed time which tells
philosophers that our thought is continuous in
some form or another. There was, however, no
sense of duty omitted—no pressure of coming work,
which in such cases destroys the charm of awakening.
I knew that there was ample time before
freedom, and enjoy the freshness and purity of
the air in this wonderful spot.

And so I did not stir, but lay on my back with
my hands under my head looking up into the
branches and watching the gleams of light
struggle through the tracery of leaf and branch.
I thought of many things, in that luxurious half-dreamy
way which belongs to the leisure of an
habitually busy man. Taking up a thread of 
thought and dropping it again—swaying between
general and particular ideas—in all ways
realizing that greatest of pleasures, intellectual
_laissez aller_.

There was in the air the same faint hum of varied sounds which had at the first lulled me to sleep; but somehow the volume was richer than before—more full and satisfying to the ear, and with a special significance, as if not only all nature was speaking but that there was someone voice amongst the myriad more potent than the rest. I listened with a growing interest, and the sound seemed to take a more definite place amongst nature's harmonies. It was not as if it grew in loudness, but merely as if the vibrations accumulated, coming in waves more quickly than they could die away.

Gradually all the other noises seemed to die away, and I heard only this one sound. It seemed to be closer and closer as I began to distinguish more clearly, until I shortly came to the conclusion that its source was separated from me by only some score of yards. Then I began to be able to analyse it a little. In general effect it was like a sort of musical muffled corncrake—a corncrake in a whisper—but with some subtle prevailing sweetness which seemed of almost irresistible attraction. Presently I raised my head from amongst the bracken where I lay, and looked whence the sound proceeded.

There, to my surprise, in an open dell where the light fell through a break in the trees were grouped the children whom I had seen. The two girls were seated, and between them the little boy stood up. One of the girls held in her left hand something which looked like a set of pandean pipes made of thin canes but slightly thicker than wheaten straws. Across this she drew something attached to the fingers of the right hand, which made the bass of the strange corncrake sound. The other girl held a shell with strings across it which she touched lightly; and the boy had a sort of reed flute which gave forth a peculiarly long sweet note, but which blended in the mass of music. Then the girls joined in a sort of monotonous chant of strange sweetness but very, very faint. They were all three looking well to one side of me. By and by the girls stood up; they all turned slightly, and I could see that they were evidently turning slowly in a complete circle, as though seeking in every direction around them. As they began to face my direction I sank down again into the bracken so that they might not see me, for the affair began to absorb my interest. I took care, however, to peep through the fronds of the bracken and see all that went on. A very short time elapsed before my attention was diverted, and in not the most pleasant of ways.

Hearing a stir and rustle among the dead leaves beside me I looked round, and almost jumped to my feet, for there close by, and approaching closer, was a large snake of the blind-worm species. It came straight towards me and actually passed over my feet. I did not stir, and it went on, heeding me no more than if I had been a log of wood, and wriggled away towards the group in the sunlit glade. It was evidently attracted by the strange, weird music, and as this was my first actual experience of serpent-charming my interest grew, and I watched the little party more closely than before. They went on with their music, and the snake approached closer and closer; till at the feet of the fair-haired child it stopped, and, curling itself into a spiral, raised its head and began to hiss. The boy looked down, and the girls turned their eyes towards him, but the music did not stop for a moment; on the contrary, it grew something quicker. Then the snake twined itself around the child's ankle and began to climb its way up his body, wriggling round and round his leg and thigh, and up and up, till at last it crawled along
the arm that held the flute.

Then, suddenly, the music stopped. The two
girls stood up, and the boy stretched out his arm
with the snake wound around it, with his hand
stretched out wide open, the palm upward.
The snake remained perfectly still, as if transformed
into stone. Then the girls took hands and circled
slowly around the boy, uttering a low, whispering,
mysterious chant, something the same as the earlier
one, but this time in decrescendo as compared with
the former crescendo, and in a minor key. This
went on for quite two or three minutes. The boy
remained perfectly still, with his arm extended,
and his blue eyes fixed on the snake. Then the
latter raised its head slightly and seemed to follow
with it the movements of the circling girls. They
continued their slow movement, round and round,
the snake's movements being more and more
pronounced with each revolution, till presently it was
boldly turning, like the automatic motion of a
firework, around the boy’s arm. Gradually the
motion of the girls got slower and the snake
correspondingly less, till, presently, the girls’
movement, and the low droning music, which had
never stopped, died away altogether, and the snake
hung, a dead mass as limp as a piece of string,
across the boy's hand. The boy never moved, but
the girls let go each other's hands, and one of them,
who had stopped just in front of the boy, took the
snake by head and tail and seemed to gently pull
it out straight. When she let it go, it lay across the
boy's hand as stiff as a piece of wood. There was
something uncanny about this which recalled to me
recollections of a man whom I had once seen in a
cataleptic fit, and whose body retained any position
into which it was put, no matter how grotesque or
how uncomfortable or strained. The snake seemed
to be under some similar condition, and with strange
curiosity I awaited the next development. The boy
continued impassive, his hand still stretched out and
the snake resting across it. The girls stood a little
in front of him, one on either side, so that the
outstretched hand was midway between them.


Then began some questioning between them in
a language which I presumed to be some form
of Indian, but which I did not understand. Both
voices were sweet, with a peculiar penetrating
power, but one of them I seemed instinctively to
fear, although it was the sweeter and softer of the
two. Somehow—and the idea was quite spontaneous—
it seemed to suggest murder. From the tones and
inflections of the voices, I gathered that all
utterances were put in the form of questions—a
supposition shortly confirmed in a strange way,
for the answers were given by the rigid snake.
When each girl in turn had had her say—and they
suggested positive and negative in their tones—the
snake would slowly turn around like the needle in
a compass, and point its head to either one. The
sweeter voice seemed to be the positive, and the
other the negative in the inquiry; and in all the
earlier questions, the snake, after turning slowly
around, remained with its head towards the
negative. This first seemed to disturb and then
annoy the positive inquirer, and her voice grew
more deadly sweet and penetrating until it made
me shudder. Then she seemed to get more and
more enraged, for her eyes gleamed with a dark
unholy light, and at the same time came her
question in a keen thrilling whisper. For answer,
the snake then spun around quicker and quicker,
and suddenly—

The disappointed one gave one fierce, short,
inhospitable hiss, while a look of deadly malice
swept over her face; and then passed away, leaving
it as serene as before. At the same instant, the
rigidity of the snake collapsed, and it hung for an
instant as limp as before, and then slipped to the
ground and lay there all in a heap without motion,
as if dead. The boy started, as though from sleep
to waking, and began to laugh. The girls joined in
the cachinnation, and in an instant the glade, which
had seemed so weird, grew instinct with laughter,
as the children chased each other into
the recesses of the wood, and disappeared from view.

Then I rose up from the bracken where I lay. I could hardly believe my eyes, and thought that I must have been sleeping, and have dreamt it all. But there lay the seemingly dead snake before me as a palpable evidence that I had beheld a reality.

The sun was far in the west when I had finished my stroll through the laneways and copses upon the Witley side of Hind Head and found myself once more at its highest point on Gibbet Hill.

The place was now deserted. The picnicers had all gone home; the pony traps and donkeys and parties of school children had disappeared, and nothing remained of the day's visitation but the usual increase in old newspapers and broken egg shells. As the light was just beginning to fade and the air to grow a shade colder, the sense of loneliness was more than ever marked. But I had come from the midst of the hum and turmoil of the city to enjoy this very loneliness, and its luxury was to me unspeakable.

Down in the valleys the mist still lay dim and fleecy white, and from it the hill tops rose dark and grim. A belt of cloud fringed the whole horizon, and above it stretched a sea of sulphur yellow, flecked here and there with little clouds of white which, swimming high above the level of the hill, caught the last splendours of the sun, now obscured by the horizon. One or two stars began to twinkle through the darkening sky, and a stillness that seemed sentient stole up through the valley and reached to where I sat.

Then the air grew colder, and the silence became perfect. The stars swam out into the sky, which had now a darker blue, and a soft light fell on the scene. I sat on and on, and drank in the wondrous beauty in which I was immersed. Weariness of mind and body seemed of the dim past, and as if they could never again be other than a sad memory. In such moments a man seems almost to be born again, and to have every faculty renewed to the full. I leaned with my back against the great stone cross, and, putting my hands behind me, clasped my arms around its back so as to change my position and be able to enjoy more fully the luxury of rest.

Suddenly, without a word of warning, each hand was grasped from behind and held tight in a pair of hands, thin and warm but so strong that I could make no movement; and at the same time a scarf or shawl of some light, fleecy, but thick material was thrown over my face and drawn tightly from behind, holding my head close to the stone. So pinioned and gagged, I could neither move nor speak, and had perforce to await the coming events. Then my hands were tied with a string put around the wrists and drawn tight, so that I was fixed more firmly than before. I could hear no sound, and took it for granted that I was being prepared for robbery. I was alone, far away from everyone and in the hands of men stronger than myself, and so resigned myself to the situation as well as I could—secretly thankful that I had only a small sum of money with me. After a time which seemed long, but which was probably of but a few minutes' duration, the scarf was pulled down so far that my eyes were free, though my mouth was still covered and I was unable to cry out.

For a few moments I was too much surprised even to think as strange what I saw before me. Instead of burly footpads with rude manner and coarse force, there were the three children who had arrested my attention earlier in the day. They stood before me perfectly still and silent for a little while, their eyes being the only features which expressed either consciousness or interest of any kind. Two of them, the boy and one girl, then smiled on me with an amused superiority, whilst the other—she who in the glade had exhibited such anger—smiled with a deadly cold hate which, bound as I was, made me shudder. This latter then approached me closer, the others remaining quite still and looking on with their superior amused smile. She took from her waist, where it was concealed in the folds of her dress, a long sharp dagger, thin, double-edged, and lethal-looking. This she proceeded to flourish before me with extraordinary dexterity and rapidity. Half the time its keen
edge actually touched my skin, and the contact
made me wince. Anon she would dart towards my
eyes till I could feel its cold point actually touching
my eyeballs. Then she would, as if hurling herself
at me with the point of the deadly weapon,
directed to my heart, but would stop just as it
seemed that my last moment had come. This
went on for a little while; but short though it
was, it seemed endless. I felt a cold chill, strange
numbness, growing over me; my heart seemed
to get cold and weak—colder, and colder—
weaker and weaker still, till at length my eyes
closed. I tried to open them—succeeded; tried
again—failed, succeeded—failed—and at length
consciousness passed away from me.

The last thing I remember seeing with my
waking eyes was the gleam of the long knife in
the starlight as it moved in the young girl's dexterous
play. The last sound I heard was a low laugh
from all three of the children.

The voice in my ears was dim and distant;
but it gradually grew louder, and the spoken
words became intelligible:—

“Wake up! Wake up, man! You will get
your death of cold!”

Coldly the word struck home, for there was
at my heart a numbness, and a chill as of death.
My consciousness struggled back into existence,
and I opened my eyes.

It was now much brighter, for a great yellow
moon had arisen, and the common was flooded
with its light. Beside me were two persons whom
at once I recognized as the “honeymoon couple”
of earlier in the day. The man was bending
over me and was shaking me roughly by the
shoulder, whilst the lady stood by, looking on
anxiously, with her hands clasped.

“Is he not dead, George, is he?” I heard her
say. The answer came.

“No! thank goodness!—He must have fallen
asleep. It is a mercy that you had the inspiration
to come out to see the moonlight view from
here; he might have died of cold. See! the
ground is white with the hoar-frost already.
Wake up, man!—Wake up, and come away!”

“My heart,” I murmured, “My heart!” for it
was icy cold. The man looked more serious, and
said to his wife:—

“Bella, this may be serious. Could you run
back to the hotel, and send someone if necessary?
It may be that his heart is affected.”

“Certainly, dear; shall I go at once?”

“Wait a minute first.” He leaned over me
again. The past was coming back to me quickly,
and I asked him:

“Did you see anywhere some children,
two Indian girls, and a fair-haired boy?”

“Yes! hours and hours ago, as they went down
the London road on a tricycle. They were
laughing, and we thought them the prettiest and
happiest children we had ever seen. But why?”

“My heart! my heart!” I cried out again,
for there was a coldness which seemed to numb me.

The man put his hand over my heart, but
quickly tore it away again with a cry of terror.

“What is it, George? What is it?” almost
shrieked the lady, for his action was so sudden
and unexpected that it thoroughly frightened me.

He stood back, and she clung frightened to his
arm, as a large blindworm wriggled itself out
from my bosom—fell on the ground—and glided
away down the hillside into the copse below.
