When I left the Royal Huts Inn, on the top
of Hind Head, in order to visit the Devil’s Punchbowl
and Gibbet Hill, immortalized by Turner
in the Liber Studiorum, I passed along a wide
straight road—the new high road between London
and Portsmouth—and shortly came to the edge of
the Punchbowl and cast my eyes on its beauty.
The fog, which had been heavy in London when
I left on this mid-October morning, extended
even to Haslemere and hung in the valleys so
that the tops of the Surrey hills rose like islands
from the sea of mist, and in the brilliant sunshine
which glorified these upper levels softened
and mellowed all the wide expanse of hill and
dale and down which ranged between me and
the Southern coast. The hill gave steeply on
all sides save the north-west, where the circular
valley opened to the plain below. All the summer
tints were chastened and mellowed; all the
full colours which the sunshine had glorified had
faded into the sere of Autumn. The pink and purple
of the heather were changed to a brown with only
a suggestion of faded colour to warm its tone.
The bracken was of rich amber and faded yellow,
and the myriads of grasses and wild flowers had
donned their winter garb—the hues of decay.
Through all this rich mass of Autumn tints, the
broom, untouched as yet by the frost, sent an
emerald flash. The green bushes which fringed 
the tiny stream running through the valley 
seemed of supernatural vividness, and the dark
green of the pines which covered the western
slope and ran down into the valley seemed to
assert in some positive way the right of nature
to maintain her own colour despite all influences.
Away to the north and west, past the
spurs and shoulders of the hill, the woods and
valleys, the copses and villages and hills and
ridges ranged in endless succession; and it was
after a long, long pause that I turned from drink-
ing in the beauty of the scene with my heart full
of the power and majesty and purifying influence
of nature’s beauty. “Here at least,” said I to my-
self, “the soul of man is elevated; and on this
higher plane of nature’s handiwork the evil of our
hearts is lulled.”

As I turned, however, I started, for, as if by the
irony of fate, there, beside me, was a grim
memorial of man’s wickedness and lust for blood—
a tombstone by the roadside, marking the
spot where a century ago a poor seaman trudging
on his way from Portsmouth was murdered.

But not the stone only was of interest; for by it
were three figures which would have arrested at-
tention anywhere. They were only children, but of
types that were not common. Two were young
Indian girls of an age which by the slower de-
velopment of English girlhood would be about
some thirteen or fourteen years; being,
however, of Eastern birth, they were
probably much younger. They stood
one on each side of the memorial stone,
looking almost like heraldic supporters, as each
with a slim brown hand resting on an elbow of the
stone, leaned her face on the hand
while looking at me gravely with long, dark,
fathomless eyes. They were both very pretty of
their type, and their slim girlish figures were
draped in black of some shimmering material,
made in a half Eastern fashion with a wide belt
of the stuff round the waist, and some kind of
dark material wound around the head and acting
as a head gear. The third of the group was a
little boy of some ten years old, with hair of spun
gold, eyes like blue porcelain, and a winning
smile on his rosy face. One might designate him
indifferently a Cupid or an angel. He was
dressed in a dark blood-coloured tunic.

For a few seconds I stood looking at this group,
they regarding me steadfastly without the slight-
est movement. Then I spoke to them, making
some remarks about the beauty of the scene. One
of the girls said, tapping the stone with her hand
as she spoke.

“Can you tell us anything about this stone,  
Sir? We are strangers.”

“I am a stranger here myself, but I think we
will find it here,” I answered, as I proceeded to
read the inscription, which is on both sides of
the stone. When I read the word 'murder,' they 
all three looked at each other and then at me,
and shuddered. Strange to say, they followed the 
shudder with a smile, though
they might be frightened, and I hastened
to add—“But you need not let this
disturb you. It all happened a hundred years 
ago, when the country was very different from
what it is now.” One of the girls said in a low 
voice, whose tones were peculiarly penetrating,

“I hope not—I trust not;” and the little boy
looked up at me with a laugh and said,

“I suppose if there were a murder now, some
one would be stuck up on Gibbet Hill!”

“Hallo! young man,” said I, “You know all about 
it, I see. I am going up to the hilltop to see the
Memorial Cross. Will you come and see where
they put the murderer?”

“With pleasure,” he said, with an air of almost
supernatural gravity, lifting his cap in acknowledgment
of my invitation. The girls bowed 
too, and we all moved up the hill together. As
we went, I noticed that the boy had one of his
hands tightly clenched. “What have you got
there?” I asked him.

“These!” he said, opening his hand and
showing me a crumpled mass of great earthworms,
wriggling in their sudden freedom. “I
love worms,” he went on. “See how they wriggle so,
and you can pull them out long!” and he illustrated
the latter fact.

“Poor worms!” said I. “Why not let them
go? They would much rather be on the ground.”

“Shan't,” was his only reply, as he shove
them into the folds of his tunic.

There were a lot of people at the cross when
we reached the top of Gibbet Hill, besides abundant
evidence of recent visitors in the shape of
ggshells and pieces of newspaper—for the cross
is a favorite picnicking spot. Amongst the
strangers, my fancy was chiefly taken by a lady
and gentleman whom I dubbed “the honeymoon
couple.” I soon became so absorbed by the
lovely view that lay stretched before me—a
wilderness of rising hilltops with green woods
and rich valleys—that I quite forgot my young 
companions. I went to the edge of the steep hill
and sat down looking eastwards, and lost myself
in the beauty of the scene.

Presently, I remembered my young companions
and looked around for them; but they had quite
disappeared—there was not a sight of them anywhere around.

My departure from London had been early, and
the walk from Hazlemere in the blazing October
sun a little fatiguing, so after a while, when I
had been all around the summit of the Head and
had, so to speak, boxed the scenic compass, I took
my way to a deep shady grove of hazel and beech
with tall pines rising over all—one of those dense
copses that creep up from the valley, throwing
jagged spikes of greenery up the slopes of the hill.
Here there was the very perfection of
autumn fullness. The undergrowth grew luxuriantly
under the shelter of the clustering pines.
The brown of the bark and the bluish bloom of
the foliage of the pines, as one gazed into the
half-dim aisles between them—the sweet aromatic
odor which they exhaled—the sleepy
silence, accentuated only by the hum of nature's
myriad vitalities—the soft, rich grass, whose
summer greenery stood untouched as yet in this
sheltered dell—all invited repose. With a
blissful feeling of content, I stretched myself on
the grass and soon lost my thoughts and my
consciousness in the interlaced branches above me.

How long I slept, I know not; but it must have
been a good while, for I felt thoroughly refreshed
as to brain, and with that half-aching sense of
cramped muscles which comes after a long period
of unchanged attitude; and there was over me
that mysterious sense of elapsed time which tells
philosophers that our thought is continuous in
some form or another. There was, however, no
sense of duty omitted—no pressure of coming work,
which in such cases destroys the charm of awakening.
I knew that there was ample time before
